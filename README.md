# Resume-Screening
Resume Screening using Python
The "Resume Scanner" is an innovative solution aimed at revolutionizing the hiring process. 
In an increasingly competitive job market, this project offers a seamless way to expedite candidate selection.
By employing advanced technologies and algorithms, the application allows employers to scan and parse resumes efficiently, saving valuable time and resources. 

This predictive feature can significantly streamline the recruitment process, helping organizations find the perfect match for their job openings. With an easy-to-use interface and powerful backend capabilities, 
the project offers a user-friendly experience for HR professionals and recruiters, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective hiring decisions. 

--Scikit-Learn (sklearn) Integration: We have seamlessly integrated scikit-learn into our project to harness the power of machine learning for resume scanning and role prediction. This widely-used Python library provides a wide range of tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more, allowing us to build accurate predictive models.

--Natural Language Processing with NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a key component of our project, enabling us to process and analyze textual data from resumes. NLTK offers various linguistic data and algorithms, making it an indispensable tool for tasks such as text tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and text classification, all of which are crucial in our application.

--Enhanced Data Processing: By leveraging both scikit-learn and NLTK, we enhance our data processing capabilities. Scikit-learn provides machine learning models, while NLTK empowers us to preprocess and analyze textual content, ultimately leading to the accurate prediction of suitable job roles for candidates based on their resumes. These libraries work in tandem to make our project efficient and effective in addressing the needs of the hiring process.
